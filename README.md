TC Unity Script
====================================

Glossary
---------------------

* `TC` - [Team City](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) Continuous Integration;
* `TC Unity Script` - this repository, made for execute Builds, Tests, and etc, inside `Unity` and from `TC` via command line;
* `TC Step Script` - script of step on `TC`. Can make some logic or just listen logs from `TC Unity Script`.
* `Unified Build Code` - Kotlin code from [tg-unified-build](https://github.com/PlayQ/tg-unified-build) repository, made for automatically create `TC Steps Scripts`.
* `Unity Project` - the current game or another project to make build, run tests, or make another manipulations on `TC`.


Principe of work
---------------------

### Step 1: Installation ###

`TC Step Script` enshure `TC Unity Script` is exist in `Unity Project`.

`TC Unity Script` can be already added to `Unity Project` to use it for convenient build running (see [Work Inside Unity](#work-inside-unity)). So `TC Step Script` should check if it's exists and copy it from this repository if not.

Also `TC Step Script` should check is `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` existed in the `Unity Project` becouse it possible `Unity Project` use `Newtonsoft.Json` libruary, but don't use `TC Unity Script`. If so, `TC Step Script` should remove dublicated `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` from `TC Unity Script` in `Unity Project`.


### Step 2: Run Unity ###

`TC Step Script` call `Unity` with command line arguments:
```
"%Unity%" -projectPath "%ProjectPath%" -logfile "%LogFilePath%" -executeMethod TCUnityBuild.Build -buildStepsData %BuildSteps% &
```
Where:
* `%Unity%` - path to `Unity`, for example `/Applications/Unity/Unity 5.6.3.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity`;
* `%ProjectPath%` - path to `Unity Project`, for example `~/Documents/Repositories/CharmKing`;
* `%LogFilePath%` - file to write logs, for example `~/Documents/Repositories/CharmKing/build/BuildLog.txt`;
* `-executeMethod TCUnityBuild.Build` - say `Unity` which method it should call. `TCUnityBuild.Build` is entry point for `TC Unity Script` steps runner. You shouldn't change this one;
* `%BuildSteps%` - data for `TC Unity Script` in `json` format. It containce all needed steps, versions, keys and another data. Formating (spaces, line brakes) doesn't matter. See [BuildStepsData Format](#buildstepsdata-format);
* `&` - should be to run `Unity` in separated thread to not block `TC Step Script` code.

Also you can use any another `Unity` command line arguments, if no restriction don't described in the [step description](#test-steps). For example UI Tests can't work with command line agrument `-batchmode` Ð¸ `-nographic`. We recomend use additional command line arguments only if it really nessasary.

See [Unity Command Line Agruments Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html). 


#### BuildStepsData Format ####

Build Steps Data set in Json format. It has 2 root nodes: `BuildParams` and `Steps`. 

`BuildParams` apply on start of `TCUnityBuild` work. All of it is optional. Possible params:
* `AndroidSdkPath` - path to AndroidSdk folder;
* `AndroidNdkPath` - path to AndroidNdk folder;
* `JdkPath` - path to Jdk folder;
* `KeystoreName` - Keystore Name for [PlayerSettings.Android.keystoreName](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerSettings.Android-keystoreName.html);
* `KeystorePass` - Keystore Pass for [PlayerSettings.Android.keystorePass](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerSettings.Android-keystorePass.html);
* `KeyAliasName` - Keyalias Name for [PlayerSettings.Android.keyaliasName](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerSettings.Android-keyaliasName.html);
* `KeyAliasPass` - Keyalias Pass for [PlayerSettings.Android.keyaliasPass](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerSettings.Android-keyaliasPass.html);
* `Defines` - contains to nodes: `Add` and `Remove`:
  * `Add` - list of defines to add to `Unity Project`;
  * `Remove` - list of defines to Remove from `Unity Project`.

Node `Steps` contains list of steps to Run. Each step should has field `Type` to edentify step type and any number of build step parametrs (see [Test Steps](#test-steps) to get information about required and optional parametrs of different steps types).

Example of `BuildStepsData`:
```json
{
  BuildParams:
  {
    AndroidSdkPath: "~/Documents/AndroidSDK",
    AndroidNdkPath: "~/Documents/AndroidNDK",
    JdkPath: "~/Documents/JDK",
    KeystoreName: "Some Name",
    KeystorePass: "Some PAss",
    KeyAliasName: "Some Name",
    KeyAliasPass: "Some PAss",
    Defines:
    {
      Add:
      [
        "Define1",
        "Define2",
        "Define3"
      ],
      Remove:
      [
        "Define4",
        "Define5",
        "Define6"
      ]
  }
  Steps:
  [
    {
      Type: "MyStepType1",
      RequiredBool1: "True",
      RequiredString1: "MyString",
      OptionalInt1: 123
    },
    {
      Type: "MyStepType2",
      RequiredBool2: "True",
      RequiredString2: "MyString",
      OptionalInt2: 123
    },
  ]
}
```


### Step 3: Steps Exequting ###

Unity will be ran and call `TCUnityBuild.Build`. It will parse all steps from `-buildStepsData` parametr, make setups, run steps in order, and write logs to selected log file. 

`Unified Build Code` should generate `TC` steps according with `-buildStepsData` parametrs. If build `-buildStepsData` has 3 steps: `Run Unit Tests`, `Run UI Tests`, and `Make Android Build`, `TC` should has this 3 stepts too in this order for correct build proccess displaying.

Every step on `TC Step Script` should listen and `echo` all logs from log file (for example with `tail` utility) to "tell" `TC` about tests results, write it to `TC Build Logs` and etc. Also `TC Step Script` should handle addition commands from `TC Unity Script`, listed bellow, to make transactions between `TC` steps.


#### TC Commands ####

* `[TC Unity Script - Fatal Error]` - something went wrong, for example, `-buildStepsData` json has mistakes. `TC Unity Script` will close `Unity` and current `TC Step Script` should skip all another Unity-related `TC` steps;
* `[TC Unity Script - Step Completed]` - current step was completed successfully. `TC Unity Script` run next step if it exist, or close `Unity`, if next step not exist. `TC Step Script` should close current step as `Successfull` and start the next one;
* `[TC Unity Script - Step Failed]` - current step was failed, for example build failed, becouse code has compile errors. `TC Unity Script` run next step if it exist, or close `Unity`, if next step not exist. `TC Step Script` should close current step as `Failed` and start next one;


### Step 4: Finishing ###

After all steps exequting `TC Unity Script` will close `Unity`. You can write additional `TC Step Script`, for example to take `Unity` licanse back and send `Slack` notifications.
