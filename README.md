TC Unity Script
====================================

Principe of work
---------------------

### Step 1: Installation ###

`TC Unity Script` can be already added to project to use it for convenient build running (see [Work Inside Unity](#work-inside-unity)). So `TC` should check if it's exists and copy to the project from this repository, if not. In addition it should check is `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` existed in the project becouse it possible project use `Newtonsoft.Json` libruary, but don't use `TC Unity Script`.


### Step 2: Run Unity ###

`TC` call `Unity` with command line arguments:
```
"%Unity%" -projectPath "%ProjectPath%" -logfile "%LogFilePath%" -executeMethod TCUnityBuild.Build -buildSteps %BuildSteps% &
```
Where:
* `%Unity%` - path to unity, for example `/Applications/Unity/Unity 5.6.3.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity`;
* `%ProjectPath%` - path to Unity project, for example `~/Documents/Repositories/CharmKing`;
* `%LogFilePath%` - file to write logs, for example `~/Documents/Repositories/CharmKing/build/BuildLog.txt`;
* `-executeMethod TCUnityBuild.Build` - say Unity what method it should call. `TCUnityBuild.Build` is entry point for steps runner. You shouldn't change this one;
* `%BuildSteps%` - data for `TC Unity Script` in `json` format. It containce all needed steps, versions, keys and another data. Formating (spaces, line brakes) doesn't matter. See [BuildSteps Format](#buildsteps-format);
* `&` - should be to run `Unity` in separated thread to not block `TC` step code. 

Also you can use any another command line arguments, if no restriction don't described in the [step description](#test-steps). For example UI Tests can't work with command line agrument `-batchmode` Ð¸ `-nographic`. We recoment use additional command line arguments only if it really nessasary.

See [Unity Command Line Agruments Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html).

### Step 3: Steps Exequting ###

Unity will be ran and call `TCUnityBuild.Build`. It will parse all steps from `-buildSteps` parametr, make setups, run steps in order, and write logs to selected log file. 
`TC` should has steps according with `-buildSteps` parametrs. If build `-buildSteps` has 3 steps: `Run Unit Tests`, `Run UI Tests`, and `Make Android Build`, `TC` should has this 3 stepts too in this order for correct build proccess displaying.
Every step on `TC` should listen and `echo` all logs from log file (for example with `tail` utility) to "tell" `TC` about tests results, write it to `TC Build Logs` and etc. Also `TC` script should handle addition commands from `TC Unity Script`, listed bellow to make transactions between `TC` steps.


#### TC Commands ####

* `[TC Unity Script - Fatal Error]` - something went wrong, for example, `-buildSteps` json has mistakes. `TC Unity Script` will close Unity and `TC` should skip all Unity-related steps;
* `[TC Unity Script - Step Completed]` - current step was completed successfully. `TC Unity Script` run next step if it exist, or close `Unity`, if next step not exist. `TC` should close current step as `Successfull` and start next one;
* `[TC Unity Script - Step Failed]` - current step was failed, for example build failed, becouse code has compile errors. `TC Unity Script` run next step if it exist, or close `Unity`, if next step not exist. `TC` should close current step as `Failed` and start next one;


### Step 4: Finishing ###

After all steps exequting Unity will be closed automatically. You can write additional steps in `TC`, for example to take Unity licanse back and send `Slack` notifications.
